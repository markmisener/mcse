"""Exercise 10.1-5"""
# Whereas a stack allows insertion and deletion of elements at only one end,
# and a queue allows insertion at one end and deletion at the other end,
# a deque (double-ended queue) alloas insertion and deletion at both ends.
# Write four O(1)-time procedures to insert elements into and delete
# elements from both ends of a deque implmented by an array.
